# prbs
Pseudo-random bit sequence generators (LFSR-2 and LFSR-4) in Common Lisp.

## Overview

This is a work in progress. The goal is to create a library of
higher-order functions that will generate PRBS sequences of [any
degree
possible](http://courses.cse.tamu.edu/csce680/walker/lfsr_table.pdf).
The functions produced by these will generate lists of bits, bytes,
bit-vectors, or unsigned integers.
